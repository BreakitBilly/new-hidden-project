I've got criminal ambition


On a suicide mission


Beat down to submission


Crucifing a Christian


See me come around the corner you are bound to be piss'n


Subtract your head from your body im a mathematitian

Sometimes

I can feel my heart racing

Sometimes

All the thrills I am chasing

Sometimes

I feel all the bones in my body are aching

Sometimes


I feel this is the life I'm meant for

But hardships are coming down time to settle the score

Ready to fight I'm sick of this cold war

Furthermore

I think I can see you searching for sensibility

Looking for the last ounce of tranquility

But we both know that ain't possible

Not even improbable

Our problems go far more than philosophical

Sometimes

I can feel my heart racing

Sometimes

All the thrills I am chasing

Sometimes

I feel all the bones in my body are aching

Sometimes


I feel im like a dreamer

but when it comes down to it im a low life schemer

so in the end ill be know for my plans and ballistics

junkies shooting up shit 

man this life is sadistic

Sometimes
